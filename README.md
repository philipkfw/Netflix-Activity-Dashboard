# Netflix-Activity-Dashboard

As an avid Tableau user, I was always curious why data analysts/scientists prefer ‘scripting’ their data visualizations which requires more practical time and effort to learn. For that, I’ve decided to experience it myself and built my first R Shiny web app using the 'flexdashboard' framework - presenting insights of my Netflix viewing history!

My dashboard can be viewed [here](https://lnkd.in/gbps3n9i)!

The packages that I’ve used for this project are;
* ‘rvest’ to web scrape Netflix content details (I.e. genres and duration)   
* ‘tidyverse’ to manipulate and visualize my data
* ‘plotly’ to enhance interactivity of my graphs
* ‘flexdashboard’ & ‘shiny’ to build the layout and interactivity of my dashboard
